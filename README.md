# 📔 Personal Diary

A modern and fully responsive Personal Diary application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI.

This project was developed as part of the **Software Engineering & AI program at WBS Coding School** to strengthen my understanding of advanced React concepts such as state management, side effects, derived state, conditional rendering, and component architecture.

The application allows users to create, edit, delete, search, and manage diary entries with persistent storage and theme customization in a clean and intuitive interface.

## 🎯 What I Learned

Through building this project, I strengthened my ability to:

- Manage complex state flows in a multi-feature React application
- Implement full CRUD functionality with proper data flow
- Structure scalable component architecture
- Use derived state without mutating original data
- Persist user preferences and data using localStorage
- Build modern UI patterns such as modals and confirmation dialogs
- Implement dark/light theme switching with persistent preference
- Debug runtime issues related to state and rendering
- Apply mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Maintain a professional Git workflow with feature branches and semantic commits

This project significantly improved my confidence in building real-world React applications with production-ready patterns.
